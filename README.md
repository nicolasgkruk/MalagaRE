# MalagaRE
Programming challenge posed by a company for an ASP.NET position

Write a small website that shows off your full-stack skills. The application should be written using .NET Core. Feel free to choose any frontend technology.

A Real Estate company operating in Malaga region needs a software to handle their properties. The user should be able to insert new properties in the system including the following details:
• Address
• Bedrooms
• Garage
• Owner Price

Besides, the market price should be calculated from the owner defined price plus an agency fee of 3% and, if the property includes a garage, an extra 5K charge.
The website should be able to list all the properties (showing the market price), edit and delete the properties using the persistence technology of your choice.
Please consider that the code should be production quality and not PoC! We leave up to you to fulfil any missing requirements.
BONUS:
Save the Location of each property and add a validation that should be raised in case the property does not belong to the Malaga region (you can use any Geolocation API for it).
